# üé∏ Guitar Chord Detector App

A real-time chord recognition app that detects the guitar chord you're playing using computer vision and keypoint detection.

## üß† How It Works

This app uses [Roboflow's](https://roboflow.com) **Keypoint Detection 3.0** model to identify the position of your fingers on the fretboard and match it with known chord patterns.

## üîç Model: Roboflow 3.0 Keypoint Detection

I trained the model using Roboflow‚Äôs **Keypoint Detection** architecture.

This model was designed to track individual finger positions and map them to specific chord shapes.

## üñºÔ∏è Training Dataset

I used a small dataset of **10‚Äì15 labeled images**, marking key points on each finger across different chord shapes (e.g. E major, A minor, etc.). This allows the model to understand what each chord visually looks like from a top-down perspective.

## üñ•Ô∏è Local Deployment via Docker

Once trained, the custom model was deployed locally using Docker. The app launches the webcam and processes the live video feed to predict in real time which chord is being played.
